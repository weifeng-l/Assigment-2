## Features

For this website there is a button on the right side of the header where users can click to go to the contact page. The main weather page itself user just have to enter the city or country name and they will be given the real time temperature, cloud percentage, wind speed and the weather condition.
### Existing Features
when user enter a invalid name or spell the country name wrongly, the javascript will catch this error and return wrong city name back to the user and have the user re enter the city or country name again.

### Features left to implement
when searching the results also showes the psi level of the area and also search automaticly by using their location to search for their area.

## testing
when testing the api the results that i have gotten back for the temperature were all in kelvin scale, i was unsure what it was but after searching through google and reddit i found that in order to change kelvin scale to celcius i just have to minus 273.15 to get the temperature in degress celcius. whenever i search for a city it always comes back as wrong city name even though the city name was correct.
